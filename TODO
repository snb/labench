Stuff to do soon:
- Move stuff in defs.h to other header files if possible.
- Write Python layer around matrix_eig() and matrix_mult() so it is possible to
  replace some C code with Python.
- Tests should be re-done in Python, using the unittest module.
- Build tests together into a single program instead of compiling several.
- Simplify set up of what to test: move compiler flags for various libraries
  into a separate file like make.inc that the user can modify without having to
  mess with the main Makefile.
- Rename real_t type because _t types are supposed to be reserved for libc.

More longer term:
- Add tests for complex number versions of ?gemm and ?geev.
- Add more functions to test.
- Test more libraries, like FLAME (http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/).
- Do multiple runs of tests and analyse the timing information to get some
  statistics.
- Add plotting functionality for timing info, perhaps with matplotlib.
- Use autoconf or something for automatic detection of what versions of various
  numerical libraries are available, and automatically test everything we can
  find.
- Support CUDA and OpenCL
